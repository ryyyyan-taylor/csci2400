# Bomb Lab

This lab was our first assignment using GDB and reading Assembly. We had to place the correct breakpoints and read through the assembly in order to figure out what input the "bomb" wanted in order to not blow up and lower our score.

##bomb
This is my bomb; each student received a personalized file upon starting the lab, so the answers would be different in each.

## bomb.c
This was the file which actually executed the bomb, running each of the phases and such. This was here just for reference, as all the information about each phase is hidden within other header files, forcing you to run the bomb and look at the assembly of each phase.
